    <p><b>Frontend -</b></p>
    <p>
      The frontend is the visible part of a website or application that users
      interact with directly, often called the ‚Äúclient side.‚Äù It involves
      building web pages using HTML (structure), CSS (style), and JavaScript
      (interactivity). Modern frontend developers often use frameworks like
      React, Vue, or Angular to create complex, dynamic user interfaces
      efficiently.

    <p><b>Backend -</b></p>
    <p>
      The backend is responsible for handling data, logic, and communication
      with the database. This includes the Application Programming Interface
      (API) or middle layer which connects the frontend to the database and the
      database itself which stores the data.
